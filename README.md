# React Vite User Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project involves building a **User Dashboard** using **React.js** with **Vite** for a fast development environment. The dashboard will fetch and display user data and user activities from a mock REST API.

The key features of this dashboard include:

- **User Profile**: Display basic user information such as name, email, and phone.
- **User Activities**: Fetch and display a list of user activities (e.g., posts).
- **API Integration**: Data will be retrieved from the **JSONPlaceholder** API to simulate real-world REST API usage.
- **Loading and Error States**: Handle asynchronous data fetching with proper loading indicators and error messages.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development environment for modern web projects.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for fetching API data.
- **CSS**: Custom styles to ensure a responsive and clean UI.

## Features in Progress

- Design a **responsive layout** for both desktop and mobile devices.
- Implement **loading states** for data fetching.
- Handle **error states** for API failures.
- Organize the project into reusable and maintainable components.

## API Endpoints

- **User Data**: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1`
- **User Activities**: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=1`
